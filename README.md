# Overview
The notebook implements transfer learning using a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify Fashion-MNIST images. It covers the complete pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

# Features
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Loads Fashion-MNIST dataset and applies transformations

Custom Dataset Class: Creates a custom dataset class with image preprocessing

Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained VGG16 model with modified classifier

Model Architecture: Freezes feature extraction layers and customizes the classifier

Hyperparameter Optimization: Includes Optuna integration for automated hyperparameter tuning

Training Pipeline: Complete training loop with loss calculation and optimization

# Key Components
Data Preparation

File Structure
TRANSFER_LEARNING_USING_PYTORCH.ipynb: Main notebook file

Fashion-MNIST dataset is loaded from /content/fashion-mnist_test.csv (1).zip

Note
This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab environment but can be adapted for local execution by modifying file paths and ensuring proper dataset availability.
